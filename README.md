# About Me Project 201

This is an about me webpage, designed according to the specs from Coding 201.

Within the body of the HTML document it contains various information about me that the user can review. After they feel ready to initiate a quiz they can click on the `<h2>` element just below the top `<h1>` element to begin the quiz. All of the information (besides the random number) can be found on the page.

After the quiz begins it will ask five y/n questions about me, followed be a random number, and then question with multiple right answers about my favorite hobbies. All of these questions will repeat if a valid response is not input. However, all of these questions can also be aborted by pressing the cancel button. Questions 6 (random number) gives you four total attempts to get the answer right and Question 7 (favorite hobbies) gives you six guesses. Questions 1-5 only give you one chance to get the answer right assuming your input is valid.
